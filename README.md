# ITS-MY-BIRTHDAY
Hello!
This is a website design which I had been preparing past 2 days for my Birthday.
I was really excited for it and had used 2 markup languages. Famously HTML5 and CSS3. The Web-design is responsive for all types of devices. 
Since according to some survery, its been recorded that most of the websites are been visited by the user from Mobile and not desktop or an tablet. 
Thus, special attention is given to the Mobile design. 

I also tried the famous CSS TYPING ANIMATION to be done at the very first landing page, but unfortunately it didn't happened the way I wanted. 
And Since I wanted the design the best for me so I just had commented the CSS ANIMATION FOR TYPING for now and surely gonna do some days later. 
I also took help from Helpful sites like W3schools, mozilla.org, and last but not the least is stackoverflow. 
It was really fun making the site, specially for myself on my special day. 
Hope you liked it. 
Thankyou so much.
